## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 60%, 50%) -> RGB(#4DA6FF). Evokes a sense of trust and modernity for a book marketplace.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) -> RGB(#F0F8FF). A desaturated tint of the primary blue creates a calm, uncluttered background.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 50%, 50%) -> RGB(#4DD6D6). Provides contrast for interactive elements and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif with a modern look, for a clean and readable UI.
- Lucide-react or Heroicons for consistent and clear iconography throughout the application.
- Rounded corners (rounded-xl or 2xl) and shadowed cards (shadow-lg) for listings.
- Button hover animations (hover:scale-105, transition) and modal transitions using framer-motion.
